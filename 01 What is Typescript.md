at end of the day we are really just writing javascript

typescript = javascript + a type system

the type system helps us catch errors during development. with normal js have to execute code first- typescript constantly analyses code - uses ‘type annotations’ to analyse our code - these are like little comments

type system is only active during development- the type system falls away - ndoe js has no idea what ts is either as well as the browser - ts doesnt provide any performance optmisation

1- write typescript code in editor

2- feed code into ts compiler- converts into plain js

3- js code gets fed into the browser

so we never execute ts we only execute ts

Typescriptlang.org/play

think of ts as a friend sitting behind you when you are coding
